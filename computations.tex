\subsection{Heights of K3 surfaces}

We found that the probability of finding a K3 surface
of height \(h\) was about \(1 / 5\), to three digits
of precision, for all heights \(h \leq 6\).
For higher heights we had less samples
and more variance, although
the probabilities seem to be less than expected
for higher heights.
